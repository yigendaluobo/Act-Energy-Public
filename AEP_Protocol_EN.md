Chapter 1 | Manifesto

The AEP protocol is built on a long-ignored yet undeniably real fact: life is not separate. You are me, and I am you; your happiness becomes my happiness, and your pain becomes my pain.

The next stage of human civilization should no longer revolve around “survival competition” and “scarcity anxiety.” Instead, it should move toward a more mature goal: with survival guaranteed, allow life to freely explore, to fail, to bloom, and to evolve.

AEP does not pursue a society with zero mistakes. On the contrary, it explicitly acknowledges:

Individuals will make mistakes

Collectives will misjudge

Exploration inevitably carries risks

Therefore, the aim of this protocol is not to “eliminate failure,” but to build a civilizational system that permits failure, can repair, and continues learning.

Chapter 2 | System Overview: Two-Layer Architecture
Transition & Dual-Track Principle

AEP is designed as an institutional architecture driven by verifiable public impact, and its deployment follows a migration route of “engineering first, then scaling; local first, then global.”

AEP does not require or assume that real-world societies can replace existing financial and asset systems in one shot. Instead, AEP defaults to pilots, special zones, local closed loops, and dual-track coexistence as a starting point: first establish—within a limited scope—a verifiable closed loop of task → evidence → verification → ledger, and only after long-run data proves feasibility and controllability, gradually expand coverage.

During migration, AEP’s core constraints remain unchanged:

DemandCoin can be minted only by verifiable PSA.

Existing assets and legacy contracts are not promised, by default, to be “automatically redeemed or repriced” inside the AEP protocol text.

AEP provides a staged institutional interface: it allows individuals, organizations, and regions to voluntarily enter AEP pilot modules (e.g., Ledger-only, vouchers, closed internal circulation, partial Layer 0), and gradually upgrade into deeper integration forms through engineering acceptance thresholds.

The purpose of these transition principles is to avoid uncontrolled systemic shocks caused by institutional replacement, while ensuring every scaling step has verifiable engineering basis, traceable rule versions, and rollback-capable risk handling.

2.1 Layer 0: Survival Stack

Basic survival (food, basic housing, basic clothing, public transportation, basic healthcare, etc.) is defined as public-infrastructure-grade service. Any natural person, regardless of whether their DemandCoin balance is positive/zero/negative, can receive baseline survival supply without discrimination.

Survival is a right, not a reward.

2.1.1 Layer 0 Upgrade Principle (Evolving Commons)

Layer 0 not only guarantees “being alive,” but also carries the responsibility to gradually raise baseline living standards as civilizational productivity improves.

Constrained by verifiable supply capacity, marginal cost, and social carrying capacity, the system will, in phases, incorporate mature, scalable, and strongly survival-linked key technologies into Layer 0 standard supply.

An upgrade is not a promise of welfare expansion, but an engineering inclusion grounded in physical deliverability:

can supply

can maintain

can audit

can roll back

Only then may it enter Layer 0.

2.1.2 SEF (Survival Evolution Fund)

To support continuous upgrades of Layer 0, the system establishes the Survival Evolution Fund (SEF), strictly limited to:

Engineering modifications, infrastructure scaling, supply-chain rollout, and long-term maintenance required for Layer 0 upgrades

Public deployment (hardware/software/process/training/standards/audit system) of key general technologies that are “publicly available or publicly licensed”

Systemic risk buffering and emergency fallback plans during upgrade implementation (without affecting baseline entitlements)

SEF is not general fiscal spending. It is not used for direct Layer 1 subsidies or private consumption assistance. Its sole mission is to convert “mature and scalable” technological dividends into baseline allocation for all humanity.

2.2 Layer 1: Experience Market

Above the survival stack, AEP preserves the free market to provide diversity, personalization, and scarce experiences. DemandCoin is used to exchange for higher-tier convenience, aesthetics, scarce resources, professional services, and extreme experiences.

Base version is free; advanced version is paid.

2.3 Quotas & Increasing Marginal Cost (Anti-Waste)

Layer 0 uses a structure of:

identity-bound + standard quota free + threshold-triggered payment

Within reasonable thresholds: free access and use

Beyond threshold: triggers DemandCoin payment (increasing marginal cost)

Thus: survival guarantees remain unaffected, while waste becomes expensive

For high-risk or high-abuse categories in Layer 1, the system may enable the “three-piece kit” of base quota + excess deposit + progressive friction per 3.3.5.5 to suppress abuse and Sybil attacks, but must not erode Layer 0 survival rights.

2.4 Free Market Projects (FMP) — Transfer Only, No Minting; Public Impact Recognition Allowed

Free market projects are voluntary collaboration and commercial/innovation project forms in Layer 1. Their core mission is to provide space for personalized experience, competition, innovation, and entertainment, while serving as the primary circulation pool and resource allocation arena for DemandCoin.

The free market obeys the Minting Law: financing, trading, dividends, and business profits within the free market are all redistribution of existing DemandCoin. No minting may be triggered by valuation, capital gains, interest-on-holding, or profit.

2.4.1 Definition & Boundary (No Minting, Only Transfer)

Transfer only, no minting. Fundraising, spending, dividends, trading, and commercial revenue are all circulation of existing DemandCoin.

No minting may be triggered by financing, holding, trading, valuation changes, capital gains, or business profit.

Project success/failure only affects credibility, collaboration capacity, and market outcomes in Layer 1; it does not automatically generate new coin.

Dual channels in parallel: Project Board and Private Contracts. Parties may choose between the public “Project Board” and peer-to-peer “Private Contracts” (see 2.4.6).

2.4.2 Public Impact Review & Recognition

To prevent real breakthroughs and excellent contributions from being missed—without breaking the minting boundary—the system allows free market outcomes to apply for Public Impact Review and enter the public project evaluation framework:

Any individual/collective may initiate a review request, claiming verifiable public benefit or quantifiable harm reduction.

Once accepted, the system creates a corresponding Recognition PSP under public-project standards, using the best available model and an invitation-based review to evaluate, attribute, and settle public impact.

Review/verification/recheck/dispute handling may be opened as PSA, but their contribution weights follow low weight + cap + dynamic calibration, with reasonable averaging across service participants; parameters and version switching must be versioned on-ledger.

2.4.3 Recognition Pricing: Count Public Impact Increment Only, Not Commercial Profit (No Double Counting)

Recognition only prices the public-impact entity itself, not commercial profit:

Recognition minting only targets: incremental public impact or incremental harm reduction that is reviewable and confirmed within baseline + noise-cancellation frameworks.

Commercial profit, market share, asset prices, valuation changes belong solely to free-market outcomes and may not be used as minting basis.

If one result has both commercial and public-impact attributes, it must be split into two paths:

commercial part: settled inside free market

public part: recognized under public-project rules

no double pricing on the same metric and same increment.

2.4.4 Acceptance Gate: Auditability & Evidence Floor (Auditability Gate)

To avoid the arbitrage path of “black-box profit first,公益-narrative laundering later,” applications must meet minimum engineering and evidence requirements:

Process and key results must retain auditable evidence (encrypted notarization / hash notarization / sharded custody, etc.), and must be providable for review after acceptance.

Key conclusions must meet the same verification foundation as public projects: multi-source redundancy, random sampling, physical constraints, correlation and consistency checks.

If requirements are unmet, at most it can enter Ledger-only (record samples and experience only) and may not trigger recognition minting.

2.4.5 Versioning & Accountability Anchoring (Versioned & Accountable)

Acceptance conditions, review processes, evidence thresholds, model versions, parameter calibration, settlement rules, and recognition conclusions must all be:

versioned and written into the chain ledger (traceable, auditable, roll-backable)

review actions and key signatures must enter the causal chain, bearing responsibilities and downstream repair duties under the AEP accountability structure.

2.4.6 Project Board & Private Contracts in Parallel

Free Market Project Board: standardized tools for public posting, recruiting collaborators, and financing matching; only transfers DemandCoin; triggers no minting.

Private Contracting: parties may bypass the board and contract directly; but if risk-control rules, audit triggers, or dispute arbitration are hit, they must still comply with AEP audit trails and accountability structures.

2.4.7 Liquidity Valves & Market Finance
2.4.7.1 Survival & Reasonable Savings Buffer

Under Root ID, AEP sets a “survival & reasonable savings buffer.” Balances within the buffer are exempt from idle-decay and friction fees.

Cap basis: anchored to a multiple of “regional annual per-capita average consumption,” typically 100–120×; specific multiple is dynamically calibrated by the model using system pressure, supply capacity, and risk data, and versioned on-ledger.

Regional boundary: regions that joined AEP are included; if new regions join before statistical release, extend collection to avoid distortion; regions joining after Lichun (true solar time) are excluded from current cycle and included next cycle.

2.4.7.2 Idle-Decay (Primary Valve): Applies Only to Excess Idle Stock, Annual Accrual with Hard Cap

Idle-decay suppresses long-term hoarding and frozen wealth, with hard constraints:

only applies to balances above buffer

accrued annually (not daily/monthly)

decay intensity has a hard cap

Idle determination: only if excess balance lacks meaningful circulation, public-purpose lock, or other reviewable non-hoarding use in rolling window; definition versioned on-ledger.

Tiered decay: segmented by excess size; larger and longer-idle decays more; smaller excess decays less.

Hard boundary: maximum annual decay cannot exceed 20% (hard cap). Thresholds and multipliers are not fixed in text; they are model-calibrated and versioned on-ledger.

Routing: decayed-out amount does not go to counterparties; it is dynamically routed to burn, SEF, and Resilience Vault, with ratios calibrated and versioned on-ledger.

2.4.7.3 Heat Friction Fee (Secondary Valve): Not Paid to Counterparty

To suppress run-like shocks after long idleness (large sudden spending), the system adds a Heat Friction Fee to transactions matching combined features; fee goes to a system routing pool.

Trigger features: long idleness + excess balance + large single spend / abnormal high-frequency spend (definitions calibrated and versioned).

Exemptions/reduced load: Layer 0 upgrade procurement, remedy projects, judicial enforcement, and system security payments may be exempt or charged lower.

Anti-evasion: account splitting, circular transfers, fake locks trigger anti-cheat and credit-hash rules and may open audit windows.

2.4.7.4 Financing Principle: Eliminate Risk-Free Lending; Use Risk-Sharing Contracts

AEP free market does not retain fixed-interest lending structures that fully shift risk to borrowers. Any capital provider must bear auditable risk exposure consistent with project outcomes. Default financing is risk-sharing contracts (investment/partnership-like).

Success trigger: profit sharing only when project success and收益 are verifiable.

Failure handling: no profit sharing; contracts specify stop-loss remedy or dissolution liquidation. Remaining physical resources can apply for public “resource recovery” projects with traceable, reviewable process.

2.4.8 Dynamic Pricing & Anti-Hoarding for Natural/Public Resources

Natural and public resources use dynamic pricing (based on scarcity, replenishment pressure, and risk signals) plus Public Buyback Parity: the system buyback price equals the original purchase price for the same buyer—blocking “buy–hoard–resell-to-system” speculation.

Purchase quotas: individuals/companies have unconditional purchase caps; certified free-market projects, reviewed public projects, and PPIP may apply for higher quotas based on project needs (model-calibrated, versioned).

Resale to free market is allowed, but with dynamic replenishment and buyback parity, hoarding premium is structurally compressed.

2.4.9 Innovation Firewall Between Layer 0 and Free Market: Tech Safe Harbor + Public as Biggest Buyer/Partner

To prevent public-scale from “maliciously intercepting” free-market innovation, AEP uses asymmetric competition rules:

Tech Safe Harbor: during patent exclusivity, Layer 0 shall not initiate clone R&D identical to the patent’s target. Layer 0 R&D should focus on cost reduction, universality, durability, and maintenance constraints rather than direct substitution.

Public as biggest buyer/partner: if a free-market technology is assessed as necessary for Layer 0 upgrades, prioritize purchase, licensing, or cooperation rather than competitive replication.

Revenue boundary for tech used in Layer 0: within exclusivity, returns follow agreement; after exclusivity ends, tech becomes Layer 0 public upgrade and no longer yields usage-based income.

2.4.10 Public–Private Integrated Projects (PPIP): Voluntary Cooperation, Risk Sharing, Information Isolation

Between “waiting for exclusivity to end” and “forced appropriation,” AEP allows PPIP: initiated by high-rank maintainers on behalf of public side or proposed by individuals/companies; voluntary and risk-sharing to accelerate usable Layer 0 upgrades.

Distinguish two paths:

transfer/licensing (Layer 0 purchases/uses exclusive tech)

co-development (joint R&D/testing/engineering)

Reward examples:

A) one-time lump-sum DemandCoin for transfer/licensing

B) usage-based payout: evaluate usage frequency, breadth, component share within the system, and verified benefit outcomes; pay by actual usage volume. Low frequency → higher unit reward; high frequency → lower unit reward. Parameters are model-calibrated and versioned.

Secrecy & info isolation: PPIP main agreement and core path are not public by default. To mobilize society without leaking secrets, the main project must be decomposed into many mutually non-interpretable subprojects released as public tasks under information isolation; subproject standards remain auditable.

Failure handling: risk-sharing applies; no interest-like return; stop-loss or dissolution; resource recovery can be publicized.

2.4.11 Conflict of Interest & Recusal: Maintainers Owning Companies

Maintainers may found/hold companies, but strict recusal applies: no maintainer may, in the name of public interest, privately cooperate with companies they or other maintainers own/control.

Any cooperation involving maintainer-held companies must be converted into a public project with open recruitment: disclose research direction and possibility range, disclose risk-control labels and signature chain; accept multi-domain signatures, random audits, and circuit breakers.

Prohibit “high-level council rule” and cartel clustering: key decisions must not be sealed by a small fixed group. Triggers, sampling intensity, and fuse thresholds are model-calibrated and versioned on-ledger.

2.4.12 Merit-Based Onramp: Free-Market Actors Becoming High-Rank Maintainers

Individuals/companies in free market may apply to enter maintainer system based on professional ability and verified public contribution. High-rank status must be locked to verifiable contribution: only sustained, significant, auditable contributions qualify. Admission thresholds and review standards are model-calibrated and versioned on-ledger.

Chapter 3 | DemandCoin: Definition & Principles
3.1 Minting Law

DemandCoin is the public-value credential in AEP. Its minting follows an immovable law:

DemandCoin can only be minted through verifiable PSA in public service projects.

The following do not mint new coins:

private transactions

speculation/arbitrage

asset holding

capital gains

This ensures money supply is always anchored to real, perceivable public value creation.

3.2 Chain Ledger & Irreversible Civilizational Memory

Each minted unit of DemandCoin (fractional allowed) generates an independent chain record at birth.

Records include: corresponding service act, the PSP it belongs to, evaluation parameters, timestamp, subsequent impact/harm and repair linkages.

Even if a coin is spent, burned, or causally reclaimed, the coin exits circulation but the associated service record and impact/harm history remain permanently, for learning, causal tracing, and civilizational memory.

Transfer-as-Ledger: DemandCoin is fully electronic settlement. Any balance-change event—transfer, payment, tax, burn, reclaim, freeze/unfreeze, rollback, correction—must generate an immutable ledger record and link bidirectionally to PSA/project/attribution pointers. Any movement without on-ledger record is invalid settlement.

Money can be consumed; contribution must not be erased. Coins may vanish, but civilization must not lose memory.

3.2.1 Implementation Prerequisites: Protocol Layer vs Engineering Layer

AEP has two layers: protocol and engineering. Protocol defines public-affairs boundary, PSA standards, impact attribution, accountability structure, incentives; engineering provides verifiability, non-repudiation, and low-cost auditing.

A self-consistent protocol ≠ a runnable system.
Without reliable data capture, identity binding, evidence notarization, random audits, and causal tracing, minting and repair cannot function; clauses remain on paper.

Feasibility depends on engineering realization of “verifiable public impact.”
Engineering should prioritize: multi-source data collection, baseline/control models, anomaly detection, random sampling, penetrating recheck processes.

Images are easier to fake; data can be attacked.
AEP does not assume data is “naturally trustworthy.” It assumes forgery cost can be raised: multi-source redundancy + random sampling + physical constraints + correlation checks make long-term systemic cheating unsustainable.

Migration priority: engineering first, then scaling.
Start with small pilots in measurable, auditable public domains; expand PSA coverage only after stable audit loops.

3.2.2 Privacy-Preserving Verification: Against Panopticon Fear

AEP aims at verifiable public impact, not publicizing private life. Data use follows purpose limitation and minimal disclosure: only what is necessary for verifying PSA validity, tracking impact/harm, and completing causal tracing.

(a) Dual-Repository Structure: Public Result Ledger vs Root Sealed Vault

Public Result Ledger (public): records only verifiable verdicts and necessary summaries: act/project IDs, verification result (valid/invalid/pending audit), settlement summary, rule version, audit event ID, verifiable proofs (e.g., certificate hash).

Root Sealed Vault (not public): stores evidence-pack hash indexes, source signatures, detailed parameters, encrypted pointers to raw data, bound permanently to Root ID for rechecks, dispute handling, and liability handoff.

(b) Publish Verdict, Not Raw Data

By default, publish verification verdicts and proofs, not raw private data, detailed processes, personal trajectories, or sensitive parameters.

(c) Reveal / Piercing with Due Process

Only under anomaly reports, high-risk signals, or case investigations may sealed vault access be pierced, with constraints:

clear cause: reason/scope/period/fields specified

notice & cooperation window in principle (except urgent harm)

minimal necessary access

full trace and accountability: every piercing action is logged with operator, scope, permission, outputs; abuse triggers liability and circuit breaker

3.3 PSA Verification & Anti-Fraud

AEP’s minting premise: no output, no coin.

To prevent task grinding, false reporting, and collusion, AEP adopts a three-layer verification structure and includes acceptors into the causal chain.

3.3.0 AI Execution Premise for Verification, Attribution, Anti-Fraud

Whether a PSA is valid, what attribution weights are, and therefore minting/reclaim/streaming/liability allocation—all are computed and decided by system AI using the best available model at that time, and that output is the sole calculation basis for settlement.

To make long-term systemic cheating unsustainable, AEP uses engineering constraints:

multi-source redundancy

random sampling & surprise audits

physical constraints (time/space fences, device signatures, process-order constraints, conservation checks)

correlation & consistency checks across sources and behavior graphs

Human maintainers/reviewers set boundaries and handle disputes and irreversible responsibilities; they do not manually compute case-by-case attribution weights to avoid infinite detail wars. Model iteration and parameter updates are allowed and must be versioned on-ledger for learning.

3.3.1 Layer 1: Physical Causal Closure

Minting requires a verifiable completion report: the system must confirm via objective data that the act caused the output or measurable harm reduction.

causal anchoring: if metrics fail thresholds or causality cannot be established, PSA is invalid; no minting.

multi-source audits: use sensors, device logs, remote sensing, energy/flow logs, runtime, etc. Examples: tree planting must show vegetation growth via remote sensing/random checks; pipeline maintenance must show improvements in leakage rate, downtime, energy use, etc.

3.3.2 Layer 2: Peer Audit with Liability

Acceptance/review is not decided by single authority. Qualified reviewers participate; their signatures enter the causal chain (“signing implies joint liability”):

reviewers bear liability proportional to influence if later fraud/risk omission causes harm.

self-protective incentives raise audit strictness.

cross-validation for high-risk/high-value: random third-party professional reviewers; blind processes when needed.

3.3.3 Layer 3: Credit Hash Circuit Breaker & Permission Downgrade

AEP is not punishment-centric, but cheating must become unbearably costly:

credit hash: built from real PSA; affects task matching weights, permission levels, task scope.

circuit breaker: confirmed collusion/false reporting triggers irreversible downgrade:

Layer 0 survival remains

but high-risk public tasks, scarce access, key certifications become restricted for a period or scope

public trace: cheating-related PSA and review chain stay on-ledger permanently.
